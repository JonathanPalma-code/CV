# Jonathan Palma
## Intro

My name is Jonathan, I’m Portuguese and I’m a software developer graduated at Makers Academy.

From a very young age, I have been passionate about video games, and I grew tremendously curious about how to build them. At the time, when I asked myself the teenager’s most important question, what do I want to become? The answer came to me as obvious - a software developer! For the following reasons:
* I absolutely love technology; 
* I have a creative mind;
* I love reinventing the world through innovation, with a strong will for improvement, not only for myself but for everything I touch.

I am now looking to move forward, into a new environment and secure a permanent position in a tech team.

## Personal Skills:
 
* Ambition
 
During my time at Bar Douro, a Portuguese Restaurant, working as a Restaurant Supervisor. I had the opportunity to accept tasks offered by my Restaurant Manager that weren't part of my duties. Even so, my goal was to learn new things.
As a Software developer there is always something new to discover while working on a project. Which makes life with more sense and fun to me, having the opportunity to learn and to keep my skills up to date.
 
* Organisation
 
Organisation is the key to keep your life easy. At Bar douro, we had a Cellar Wine which contained about 100 different types, regions and grapes. I was responsible for the Wine Stock Management. To keep everything organised and clean so the employees could grab a wine from the cellar, when sold. 
We arranged it by region. At the top you could find the ones that belong to the north, going down the one by the center and, finally at the bottom, the ones from the south. All divided by columns of red, white, rose and port wines.
 
* Teamwork
 
During my time in a restaurant called La Petite Bretagne I was working as an Assistant Manager. I realised how everyone is different from everyone. And dealing with people can be a difficult task. I had to face myself with how to give feedback to the employees so they could improve their work and achieve the same goal as the company. The solution that I found was to be truthy, direct, respectful, to feel empathy and to make them feel comfortable, safe and secure in the environment and with the staff.
 
## Hobbies

* Board games - Chess & Cluedo
* Sports - Football, Baseball and Basketball
* Strong passion for Video-Games - Guild wars 2, Final Fantasy and Pokemon
* Cooking - Portuguese and South American recipes
