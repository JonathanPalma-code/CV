# Jonathan Palma
## Intro

My name is Jonathan, I’m Portuguese and I’m a software developer graduated at Makers Academy.

From a very young age, I have been passionate about video games, and I grew tremendously curious about how to build them. At the time, when I asked myself the teenager’s most important question, what do I want to become? The answer came to me as obvious - a software developer! For the following reasons:
* I absolutely love technology; 
* I have a creative mind;
* I love reinventing the world through innovation, with a strong will for improvement, not only for myself but for everything I touch.

I am now looking to move forward, into a new environment and secure a permanent position in a tech team.

## Personal Skills:
 
* Ambition
 
During my time as a Restaurant Supervisor at Bar Douro, I had the opportunity to show ambition and challenge myself by taking on tasks that were not part of my duties. I always strive to learn new things. As a Software developer there is always something new to discover while working on a project, which really appeals to me as it gives me the chance to learn and to keep my skills up to date.
 
* Organisation
 
At Bar Douro, organisation was key as we kept stock of over 100 different types of wines. Being responsible for the Stock Management, I helped conceive an organisation plan that enabled employees to access all products easily, thus facilitating sales and improving the general system in place. This avoided delays in finding the wine that the client requested, misplacing deliveries or losing items.
 
* Teamwork
 
Coming from an international background, I had quickly realised how important it is to take cultural differences into account when dealing with colleagues or customers. As a Restaurant Assistant Manager, It was my responsibility to give feedback to the employees so they could improve their work and strive towards the same goals as the company. I always made sure to bring empathy in these conversations so that it was based on trust, honesty and respect. This was crucial to keep a good work environment for everyone.

* Sports - Football, Baseball and Basketball
* Strong passion for Video-Games - Guild wars 2, Final Fantasy and Pokemon
