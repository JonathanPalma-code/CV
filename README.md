# Jonathan Palma

I am a Software Developer graduated at Makers Academy. However, before, I had already a background of programming on C# due to my passion for video-games.

Back in Portugal, I faced myself for the first time with a programming language, where I discovered a passion that it was hided inside of me. A passion to create and to innovate, coming with it, to improve my originality level. Not just for Video-Games, but for Applications, that was mostly applied from the "server-side".

I am now looking to move forward, into a new environment and secure a permanent position in a tech team.

## Personal Skills:
 
* Ambition
 
During my time at Bar Douro, a Portuguese Restaurant, working as a Restaurant Supervisor. I had the opportunity to accept tasks offered by my Restaurant Manager that weren't part of my duties. Even so, my goal was to learn new things.
As Software development there is always something new to discover while working on a project. Which makes life with more sense and fun to me, having the opportunity to learn and to keep my skills up to date.
 
* Organisation
 
Organisation is the key to keep your life easy. At Bar douro, we had a Cellar Wine which contained about 100 of different types, regions and grapes. I was responsible for the Wine Stock Management. To keep all organised and clean so the employees could grab a wine from the cellar when sold. 
We arranged it by region. At the top you could find the ones that belong to the north, going down the one by the center and, finally at the bottom, the ones from the south. All divided by columns of red, white, rose and port wines.
 
* Teamwork
 
During my time in a restaurant called La Petite Bretagne I was working as an Assistant Manager. I realised how everyone is different from everyone. And dealing with people can be a difficult task. I had to face myself with how to give feedback to the employees so they could improve their work and achieve the same goal as the company. The solution that I found was to be truthy, direct, respectful, to feel empathy and to make them feel comfortable, safe and secure in the environment and with the staff.

* Sports - Football, Baseball and Basketball
* Strong passion for Video-Games - Guild wars 2, Final Fantasy and Pokemon
